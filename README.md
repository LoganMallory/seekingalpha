# Seeking Alpha
Seeking Alpha crowd sources articles about stocks and companies from screened authors. There are two sections on their website named Long Ideas and Short Ideas, respectively. This repository serves as the hub for the data, code, and analysis related to these stock ideas. I hope others find this dataset interesting and share any insights they find.

The dataset is stored externally on Google Drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BaMUxpAYNZ9ZeYSObhF97b9QKbMTYtyc?usp=sharing
